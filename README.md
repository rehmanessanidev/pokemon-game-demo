# pokemon-game-demo
A pokemon inspired game created using JS and HTML canvas

My second game project developed alongside a tutorial. From this tutorial I learned the very basics 
of the mechanics for a top down Rpg game. I learned a great deal with JS OOP. This the the largest
project I have done so far and I am excited to see how well it turned out.
