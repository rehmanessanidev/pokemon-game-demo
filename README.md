# pokemon-game-demo
A pokemon inspired game created using JS and HTML canvas

My second game project. From this project I learned the very basics 
of the mechanics for a top down RPG game. I applied my knowledge of object-oriented programming in JavaScript. 
This is the largest project I have completed so far and I am excited to see how well it turned out.
